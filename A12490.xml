            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The third lye is, that we do affirme, that the fathers and prophetes of the old teſtament did not eate the bodie of chriſt &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke his bloud, where we ſay they did it not corporally (as we nowe do) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſpiritually throughe fayth, and ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous lyuinge.

                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2</note> is that bread is called our lordes bodie, which is very falſe, for there is no men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion at al of any bread, but of our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bodie, and he ſayeth that that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portion of his bodye ſhould not be myxed wyth the meate, that is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the bealy, or ſtomake, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyed out at the foundament, declarin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge plainly therby that it is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial bread, for then it ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo digeſted yn the ſtomacke and caſt out at the foundament, as other meates be. Wherfore my lord was heryn ouerſeene. The ſecond thinge that ye note of S. Clementes wordes is that the bread (as ye calle it falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ought not to be reſerued, when he

The prieſtes, deacons and miniſters ought with feare and tremblinge keepe the leauinges of the broken peaces of our lordes bodie, that no corruption be fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>unde in the holy place, leaſt by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence great ynyurie be done to the portion ef the lordes bodie. My lord wynked at theſe wordes, &amp; toke thoſe only that ſeamed to make with hym and yet did not, for S.

Why then ſayeth my lord that Theophilus wrote not the ſentence aboue recited vpon S: Marke, but it was only writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his tyme of Theophilactus? Myght not Theophilus firſt write it, and Teophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactus borowe it of hym, as Theophila<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctus did many ſayinges of Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom?

The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de that chriſtes bodi
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:5259:150"/> and bloud are not in the holi ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but only bread, and wyne. The thirde that chriſtes bodie is not offered in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at maſſe. We do confeſſe that chriſtes ſacrifice made vpon the croſſe was ful, perfecte, ſufficient, and did &amp; doth ſtil put away the ſynnes of al them, that beleue perfectly in hym, truſt in goddes mercy, repent their il<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyues, and receaue the holy ſaeramen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, by which, as meanes, that chriſtes ſacrifice is, and neades muſt be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them, and therfore it cometh not of any imperfection of chriſtes ſacrifice, ones made for euer vpon the croſſe, that his bleſſed bodie is offered daily in ſacrifice for oure ſynnes, but only to applie that perfecte ſacrifice vnto vs, for to take away actually ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re imperfectenes of ſynne. This a un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare is ſufficient for the ſoilynge of al that is brought out of S. paules epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vnto the hebrews.

Canye therby proue, my lord, that chriſte offereth not hymſelfe yet daily at maſſe, by the prieſt as his miniſtre, for an applyi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de not god by Moſes, that Aaron, and his ſonnes, ſhould offre ſacrifices, that <note place="margin">

Hytherto chryſoſtom, out of whoſe wordes many notable leſſons may be gathered for the confutation of al your raylinge reaſonynge, my lord, &amp; falſe chargynge of al catholike teachers wyth many thinges, which they neuer dreamed vpon. The firſt leſſon is, that notwythſtandynge that ſaint paule affirmeth that chriſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer but ones offered vpon the croſſe, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:5259:158"/> that he made al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfect wyth that his one ſacrifice, which are made holy, yet prieſtes do offre hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dayly at maſſe. The ſeconde is, that this oure oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of chriſt, is not à kilynge of hym, but à remembrynge of his death. The third leſſon is, that we offre dailie, and euer one, and the ſelfe ſame hooſt, or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which can not be verified of bread and wyne, for they are not one and the ſame in many places, but it is only true of chriſtes body and bloud, that are one, and the ſame in al places, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they be offered in ſacrifice. The fourth leſſon is, that the thynge offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is the lambe chriſte, that is offered in ſacrifice dailie in many places, and yet he is but one chriſt, which is here vpon this aulter, and there (vpon that) ful, one body, and not many bodies, &amp; one ſacrifice. The fifte leſſon is, that prieſtes do dailie offre in ſacrifice that ſame hooſt, or ſacrifice, which chriſte hymſelfe offered ones by his death to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:5259:158"/> clenſe vs from ſynne. The ſyxt and laſt leſſon is, that the hooſt or ſacrifice which prieſtes do offre dailie, can not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed, and therfore it is not bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, and wyne, for they are ſone conſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med, but chriſtes body &amp; bloud, which are not conſumed in eatinge, and drin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of them, but they ſtil euer remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne whol, and ſafe. Nowe à ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſee euidently that my lordes doctrine is againſt ſaint Chryſoſtoms beliefe and teachinge, and that he rayleth vpon hym, and his doctrine in this his laſt booke. For firſt my lord ſayeth, that prieſtes haue inuented of them ſelfes à newe ſacrifice, vnto the great blaſphemie, &amp; yniurye of chriſt. But ancient docters ſaye that chriſt hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe offered the ſame ſacrifice (that prieſtes offre at maſſe) both at his laſt ſoupper, and vpon the croſſe alſo, and commaunded prieſtes to offre yt in remembraunce of his death, as theſe autoritees do ſhewe manyfeſtly. S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus

                     <hi>Homi.</hi> 2. <hi>in</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> old lawe.
